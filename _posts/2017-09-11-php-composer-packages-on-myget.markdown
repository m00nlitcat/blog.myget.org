Good news everyone! We just shipped <a href="https://www.getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">PHP Composer</a> support on <a href="https://www.myget.org/php-composer">MyGet</a>! If you are building PHP applications and libraries, you can now package them and add these to your MyGet feeds.

PHP Composer support is available for all MyGet accounts - check the <a href="https://docs.myget.org/docs/walkthrough/getting-started-with-php-composer" target="_blank">PHP Composer features described in our documentation</a>

## Which features are available?

We currently support almost all features we have available for other package managers. Of course you can upload your own packages (via the web UI as well as via a [<code>curl POST</code>](https://docs.myget.org/docs/walkthrough/getting-started-with-php-composer)) or packages from upstream repositories like [Packagist](https://www.packagist.org).

Packages can be consumed in any PHP Composer-based project. It's possible to proxy upstream repositories into your MyGet feed. You can manage permissions and users, inspect package licenses and vulnerabilities, ...

Build services are supported as well: as long as there is a `composer.json` in your repository, we'll run tests against it, package it up and make it available as a PHP Composer package on your Myget feed.

## Sounds great! How do I get started?

Quite easy: head over to [www.myget.org](http://www.myget.org) and sign in (or register). You can then create a feed and start adding packages. Our [getting started documentation](https://docs.myget.org/docs/walkthrough/getting-started-with-php-composer) has some more details on how to upload your first PHP Composer package to MyGet.

We're really excited about introducing PHP Composer support on MyGet! You can now use MyGet to securely host and collaborate on NuGet, symbols and sources, Chocolatey, PowerShell, NPM, Bower, Maven, PHP Composer and VSIX packages.

*Happy composing!*
